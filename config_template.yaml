# List any pools you want to backup
# - pool_name: the name of the pool, also the label under /dev/disk/by-label/
#              current limitation is that each pool_name can only be used once
# - autobackup_parameters: the command line arguments you want to pass to zfs-autobackup
# - split_parameters (optional, true by default): controls shell-style word splitting on zfs-autobackup parameters.
#                     E.g. if you use '--set-properties readonly=on' this needs to be true (or unset).
# - passphrase (optional): encryption passphrase, can be an empty string
